# AR Quick Look Integration

You can read [this article](https://medium.com/@anand2nigam/how-to-implement-ar-quicklook-in-your-app-18d513a13b9f) to know how this repository can help you in using AR Quick Look in your iOS Application. This will let you provide an experience of Augmented Reality to your users without even going through the hassle of learning about AR concepts.



This implementation of AR-Quick-Look uses 3D model of format [USDZ](https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/docs/Usdz-File-Format-Specification.html) (introduced by Apple in collaboration with PIXAR). If you are not aware of this, I'll suggest to go through [this blog](https://medium.com/better-programming/what-is-usdz-and-how-to-convert-your-3d-model-to-usdz-dac2e6205036) to help you get started.
